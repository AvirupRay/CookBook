## Cook's Book: Recipe Generator Built to Rescue Your Fridge

### Inspiration

It all began with a burnt pan and a fridge overflowing with forgotten leftovers. A hungry college student facing a culinary wasteland, I stared at a lone chicken breast and withering vegetables, yearning for a recipe that used what I actually had. Frustrated by existing recipe databases that demanded specific ingredients, a spark ignited! Why not create a recipe generator that empowers, not restricts? Imagine a tool that transforms your random fridge finds into delicious dishes!

### What it Does

Cook's Book is a recipe generator with a twist. Unlike traditional recipe sites, it doesn't require a specific shopping list. Instead, you tell Cook's Book your ingredients, and it creates recipes based on those.

### How We Built It

**Development Tools:**

* Programming Languages: Javascript
* Databases: MongoDB
* Web Frameworks: Express.js, React.js

**Technical Deep Dive:**

* Machine Learning: We implemented the Gemini API for recipe generation.

**Challenges Faced:**

* Integration of Gemini API with Node.js presented errors.
* Implementing Auth0 for website security was a first-time experience.

### Accomplishments

* Successfully integrating Auth0 and the Gemini API, a significant feat for the project's stage.

### What We Learned

* **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning, organizing, and manipulating vast amounts of ingredient and recipe data.
* **API Connection:** Authentication of the Gemini API.
* **Project Management:** Keeping all project components on track and functioning seamlessly.
* **Communication Skills:** Clear communication is essential for project success.

###  What's Next for Cook's Book

* **Meal Planning Assistant:** Cook's Book could suggest recipes for the entire week, utilizing overlapping ingredients and minimizing waste.
* **Dietary Customization:** Personalized recipe recommendations based on allergies, intolerances, and specific health goals.
* **User-Generated Recipes:** A platform for users to submit and share their creative recipe variations, expanding the database and fostering a community of cooks.
